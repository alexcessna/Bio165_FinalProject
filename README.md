# Measuring the Impact of Interferon–β on Flu Vaccine Efficacy

## Overview of Repository
This repository has a simple structure and is designed to be built upon as the overall research project progresses beyond this preliminary phase. Currently, it consists of one folder, titled 'project_data' as well as a written report of the findings so far. The report should be referred to for more information regarding the background information behind this project as well as for a detailed description of the experimental design and data analysis process. The 'project_data' folder contains the code for our analyses for 3 different strains of the Influenza Virus, split into 3 different Jupyter Notebook files, as well as the raw data used in our analysis.
